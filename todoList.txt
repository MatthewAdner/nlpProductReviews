kaggle is a place where there is a bunch of datasets largely for free
    there is often code
    kaggle is very cool

NLP pipeline
    get rid of stop words
        also emojis
        "retweet"

find libraries for anger/fear/other emotions
watson natural language processing has a thing, maybe 
    look for an open source thing that does something similar

kaggle has some stuff with amazon reviews, some of it has starter code
    look at this, maybe use it

TODO before next session
    narrow in on project
        this could be done by looking through kaggle datasets
    find a dataset and use it to inspire a project idea
    also look at other people's work with NLP and stuff

    !!!Newer hypothesis that is more doable!!!
